# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

## My name is Candace, I'm a data analyst based in the DC area. 
I use Python and PostgreSQL to draw insights and pose new questions. 
My latest project is analyzing my monthly spending with Python to create a realistic budget that I can stick to.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working as a research and GIS analyst.

My true passion isn't set in stone, but I love learning new tricks in Python and SQL to manipulate data. YouTube University and Stack Overflow have been lifesaver's throughout my first full-time analyst position.

In my free time away from the computer I enjoy woodwork, reorganizing my apartment, and chatting with my :smiley_cat:, Wednesday.
