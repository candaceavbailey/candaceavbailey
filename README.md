# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 

## My name is Candace, I'm a data analyst based in the DC area. 
>I use Python and PostgreSQL to draw insights and pose new questions. 
My latest project is using data from Spotify APIs to analyze trends in popular songs and music genres. 
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning regression models and finishing my final project with CareerFoundry.

I have a passion for learning new programming languages. In my free time away from the computer I enjoy woodwork, comedy shows, and chatting with my :smiley_cat:, Wednesday.

I'd love to connect on [![LinkedIn][3.2]][3].
### You can check out some of the new vegan dishes that I cook @makingyum on Instagram :avocado:.
